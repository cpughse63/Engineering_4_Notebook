This is where all of my stuff will go!

## Hello Raspberry Pi Zero
### Lessons Learned
For this assignment, we first set up and plugged in our Raspberry Pi Circuit. This took us a little while, just finding all of the parts and wires and making sure everything was plugged in in the right place. We had a hard time telling apart some of the cables and usbs at first. Once we got everything wired, we began to learn how to code on Terminal. We learned to write a bash script and a loop to display "Hello World" ten times! The main thing we learned from this assignment was the new syntax, since it is very different and much more straight-forward than coding on Arduino.

## Hello Mathematica
### Lessons Learned
In this assignment we learned how to set up and use Wolfram Mathematica on our Rasperry Pi Zero. We learned how to use integers, and to eventually make a moving plot graph animation! We learned to not only produce the graph, but to make it interactive since we could slide little bars to change aspects of the plot. We had a hard time with this, but after plotting the graph, we researched how to turn it into an animation and make it interactive and eventually we were successful!

## Hello Python
### Lessons Learned
For this assignment we learned the python script by writing a loop to print "Hello World" ten times. Then, we learned how to code a program that randomly generated a number between 1 and 6, so essentially a dice roller. It took us a little while to figure this out, but what was hardest for us was getting it to start upon the user's request, and then to stop again when asked.

## Python Program 01 - Calculator
### Lessons Learned
In this assignment, we learned to use Python to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder of two numbers. We asked the program to print the return from our function. The tricky part was figuring out how to use one function for each of the equations.

## Python Program 02 - Quadratic Solver
### Lessons Learned
This assignment asked us to calulate a discriminant after inputting three coefficients. The program then returns a message based on the value of the discriminant. The hardest part of this assignment for us was figuring out how to return an array, and learning how to use "if," "elif," and "else" statements with each other.

## Hello Git
### Lessons Learned
We set up our git pages. We also learned how to commit and push files so that we can save our code in GitHub instead of just on the Raspberry Pi.
## Git - Forks and Clones
### Lessons Learned
We learned how to use the collaborative part of GitHub, and added our names and fun facts to the cool-repo page. Since we were just following directions for this assignment, it went pretty quickly, though we did have some trouble thinking of fun facts.
## Git - Engineering 4 Notebook
### Lessons Learned
We added the previous assignments to our notebook. It was not very challenging, just time consuming.
## Python Program 03 - Strings and Loops
### Lessons Learned
The code for this was not very long, but it took us a while to figure out how to split the sentence into words, and then break the words down into letters. We originally assumed we could use the same process for both of those actions, but eventually realized that we needed to use a list for the letters instead.

## Python Challenge - MSP
### Lessons Learned
This assignment was a lot of fun, but it took us forever! We had to draw on a lot of the previous assignments and find bits of code from all over the internet to complete it. When we tried to code the hangman image, we had to figure out how to get each arm and leg to appear individually. At first, it would print all the stages, so we had to adjust the code to make the prior arm/leg stages disappear as another one appeared. Eventually we figured out how to get the function to skip over some of the stages while printing the list. We also had some trouble replacing the blanks in the word with real letters, rather than just adding the letters at the end of the line of blanks. Once we finished the game, we had fun making everyone test it.

## GPIO Pins - Bash
### Lessons Learned
This assignment involved a lot of soldering so we could connect the T-cobbler to our Pi. After that, the code was pretty simple once we figured out which pins matched up. We found an image online that was helpful.
### Code

## GPIO Pins - Python
### Lessons Learned
This code was pretty similar to the last assignment. The only challenge here was figuring out how to get Python to interact with the GPIO pins. It took only a few extra lines of code.

## GPIO Pins - SSH
### Lessons Learned
In Canvas, this assignment asks, "what good is a computer without an internet connection?" Turns out, our computer hates connecting to the internet, so although the code was simple and we were able to download the app, the assignment took us longer than it should have. We also had changed our password, so it took us a bit of time to remember that. We now know to watch out for our wifi connection though. We ended up switching computers to try to get a better connection.
## Hello Flask
### Lessons Learned
Most of this assignment was just following directions from Canvas, but it was interesting to see how we could use Flask to connect to a web browser. Again, we ended up wasting a lot of time waiting for our bad wifi connection.
